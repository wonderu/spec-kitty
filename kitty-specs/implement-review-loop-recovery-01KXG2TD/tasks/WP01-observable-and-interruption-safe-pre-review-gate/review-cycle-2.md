# WP01 Review Cycle 2 — Approved

Independent cycle-2 review passed all acceptance criteria and the contract round-trip.

- Focused suite: 80 passed.
- Ruff, mypy, terminology guard, and diff check passed.
- Windows descendant cleanup uses tree-aware `taskkill /T` with bounded `/T /F` escalation and platform-shaped branch tests.
- Timeout and catchable-cancellation residue snapshots cover authoritative state, event logs, WP bytes, Git placement, and owned dirty paths across primary, coordination, and lane checkouts.
- SIGKILL coverage terminates the actual Typer command while it is synchronized inside the real pre-review gate, reaps the orphaned runner child, and reconciles against authoritative status.
- Historical RED commit `808290927` remains test-only; its liveness assertion was not weakened.

This approval supersedes the cycle-1 rejection without deleting or rewriting that review history.
