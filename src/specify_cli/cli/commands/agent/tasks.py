# this move ALL five command families are out of this module). Every moved
# symbol is re-imported here in the explicit ``as`` re-export form so
# ``tasks.<name>`` stays a module attribute — the seam surface (NFR-002). The
# relocated bodies route every patched seam symbol back through
# ``_tasks.<attr>`` (lazy in-function import, research.md D1/D7), so
# ``@patch("...agent.tasks.<sym>")`` / ``monkeypatch.setattr(tasks, ...)``
# keep INTERCEPTING (incl. ``bootstrap_canonical_state``, the conftest
# ``console`` rebinding and the port adapters constructed by the moved
# ``_default_finalize_ports`` — the plain ``RealCoordCommitRouter``; finalize
# has ZERO direct emission sites, research.md D3). read-surface-ssot-closeout
# WP08: the former ``resolve_feature_dir_for_mission`` pre30-guard-wiring seam
# is RETIRED — ``_ft_apply_writes`` now calls
# ``mission_runtime.placement_seam(...).read_dir(STATUS_STATE)`` directly
# (no ``_tasks.<attr>`` proxy for this symbol). The
# ``@app.command`` Typer wrapper below stays here: the CLI surface
